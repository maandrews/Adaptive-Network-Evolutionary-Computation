# Adaptive Network Evolutionary Computation

This program uses evolutionary computation to simulate an adaptive network (graph) where its nodes are modelling a 
population vulnerable to disease.  Nodes may use different strategies to rewire their connections within the network
in order to avoid becoming infected.  The best strategies are replicated from generation to generation, in order to find
the optimal strategy that maximizes influence in the network.

The objective of this project is to study the strategy evolution of nodes in an adaptive netwotrk and the resulting effects on disease prevalence, as well as the evolution of the network's topology as the nodes compete for influential positions on the network while trying to maintain a non-infectious state.
